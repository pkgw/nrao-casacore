// CasaThreadNeturality.h.in
//
// This file is configured by CMAKE to possibly define
// two C++ preprocessor symbols:

// CASA_THREAD_NEUTRAL and
// USE_BOOST_SHARED_PTR.
//
// This file is then included as needed to insure that
// compiles using casacore (e.g., casa itself) will
// have symbols defined the same was as in the casacore
// build.  This provides a coordination between the
// casa and casacore build with out introducing too
// much coupling.  -- Jim Jacobs 2012-03-01
